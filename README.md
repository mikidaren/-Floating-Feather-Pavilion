作品简介：
The design inspiration of the Floating Feather Pavilion stems from the beauty of birds' lightness and fluidity. We chose bamboo as the material due to its natural vitality and resilience, which can interpret the delicacy and elegance of feathers. 

As a result, the Floating Feather Pavilion possesses both visual aesthetics and the symbolic significance of harmonious coexistence between wind and humans.

Furthermore, we attempted to simulate the posture of two waterbirds embracing each other, presenting a serene and harmonious beauty on the water's surface. 

Simultaneously, we innovatively introduced feather-like appendages, which not only enhance the visual hierarchy of the architecture but also enable the Pavilion to interact subtly with wind elements.

The bamboo swaying in the wind exhibits a unique rhythmic sense, adding a touch of liveliness and elegance to the entire design.\n
